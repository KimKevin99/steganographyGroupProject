# steganographyGroupProject
# This project will involve sending and receiving text files
# that represent packets. There will be both encrypted files with and without a key. 
# 
# Project Charter
# File Compression: Image Steganography
# 5/15/18

# Project Statement: We will develop a program that can encode a text message within an image. 

# Concise Project Overview: This project is meant to help hide a message in plain sight (steganography), and should only be able to be decrypted if the key is provided. 

# Scope Statement: The final project should be able to complete four main objectives: 
# Encode a message into an image
# Send this message to a recipient
# Generate a key to encode the message randomly within the image
# Be able to decode a message if given the key

# Stakeholders: Allen Zhou, Daniel Wan, Kevin Kim 

# Timeline: 5/15 - 6/11

# Budget Estimates: Lots of hours

# Risks and Contingency Plans: If we fall behind, it will be difficult to make up the necessary work. There is no back-up solution to this.
